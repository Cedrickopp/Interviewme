# AI Interview Agent – "My AI Avatar"

A personal interview agent that serves as a digital twin, representing my skillset, experiences, and projects. Recruiters can ask questions through a web interface and receive responses as if they were speaking directly with me – without requiring my physical presence.

## Objectives

* Web application allowing users to interview my AI avatar (based on my profile, projects, etc.)
* GPT-based response generation through Python Cloud Functions
* Admin-only access (initially), with future authentication system for external users
* Cost-effective, secure, modular & scalable architecture

##  Authentication Proposal (Future)

When you want to enable public user login or provide agents for others, here are three **modern authentication systems** to choose from:

| Option            | Advantages                                                           | Disadvantages                      |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Clerk.dev**     | Super easy Vue integration, Google/Apple/Email, GDPR-compliant       | Monthly costs after limit         |
| **Auth0**         | Widely used in enterprise, many providers                            | Slightly heavy for small projects  |
| **Supabase Auth** | Open Source, Email Magic Link, OAuth ready                           | Less polished UI than Clerk/Auth0  |

**Recommendation:** For future scaling: **Clerk** – good mix of UX, pricing, and Vue compatibility.

##  Roadmap (MVP v0.1)

###  Setup Phase

* [x] Configure Firebase project & Cloud Firestore
* [x] Set up Firebase Hosting for Vue frontend
* [x] Configure Cloud Functions (Python 3.10+) via `gcloud` CLI
* [ ] Store OpenAI API Key in Google Cloud Secrets Manager

### Backend (Agent Logic)

* [ ] Create data structure in Firestore (`profile`, `faq`, `session_logs`)
* [ ] System Prompt Template + dynamic User Prompt
* [ ] Python Cloud Function: OpenAI call with guardrails
* [ ] Token limits, timeout, logging & basic filtering
* [ ] Test function with mock data

### Frontend (Vue 3)

* [ ] Initialize Vue CLI project (`vite` or `vue-cli`)
* [ ] Bootstrap integration (Vue-compatible via CDN or package)
* [ ] Chat component with question form, loading indicator & response display
* [ ] Auth guard for admin access
* [ ] "About me" page (static CV, projects)

### Auth & Hosting

* [ ] Firebase Auth for admin with Google login
* [ ] Define "admin" role in Firestore or via claims
* [ ] Login component & protected routes
* [ ] Deployment via Firebase Hosting (CI optional)

## Current Setup

### Firebase Configuration
- Project initialized with Firestore, Storage, Functions, and Hosting
- Admin-only Firestore security rules implemented
- Local emulators configured for development
- Emulator ports:
  - UI: localhost:4000
  - Functions: localhost:5001
  - Firestore: localhost:8080
  - Hosting: localhost:5000
  - Storage: localhost:9199

## Open Questions

* **Profile Structure**: JSON vs Markdown vs Firestore document – how to maintain content?
* **Session Storage?** Store past questions/answers?
* **Cost Management?** Budget or limit API usage (tokens)?
* **Improve Agent Understanding?** Later use embeddings & vector database?
* **Public Access?** Make agent accessible to recruiters without login or via invitation?

## Local Development

### Setup

```bash
# Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login
firebase init

# Google Cloud SDK for Python Functions
https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install

# Local Emulation
firebase emulators:start
```
